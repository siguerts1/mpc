# MPC â€” Multipass Cluster Controller

**MPC** is the central CLI tool that federates multiple Multipass-capable hosts into a unified VM cluster. It connects to `mpcd` agents running on each host and lets you view and manage distributed Multipass instances from a single command-line interface.

- Discover Multipass VMs across many hosts

- Golang 1.21 or newer
